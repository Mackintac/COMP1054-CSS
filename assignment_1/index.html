      <h4>
        Lovesick like a dog with canine sensitivity Developing this new theory
        of relativity Connecting our souls resting in captivity Positive life
        sacrifice what it is to me Our history, only a quarter of a century
        Reality, sitting on the shoulders of our chemistry See ain't no mystery,
        the colors that we mix will set the mind free Let the blind see beyond
        harmony! Breathe life into dead space blow away your clouds of doubt New
        territory we determine to be Everything a safe haven it's supposed to be
        Now it might seem distant but the time is near When our thoughts take
        off and split the atmosphere Pure sound wave travel semi-infinitely Plus
        I'll see you there utmost definitely

        Good gracious, every process has a genesis and ends with a revelation
        God bless this opportunity for me to find a voice For some words that
        have waited for way too long Low wages, small tips on the avenue Never
        wasted, all hits for a revenue Haven't you heard the news lately? Seems
        we've been living for some time in a purgatory But yo, I thought I knew
        what a love song sound like But I felt a warmer tune in the sunlight I
        could still hear it in my room past midnight Gotta move, take a solo
        cruise in the moon light Sometimes I do forget, oh how much we could
        ease the lives we lead If we learn to let go, the reins that we hold
        Return to our souls, and the spirit let flow So you see, upon everyday
        faced there's a million shades to Express definition of grace But the
        method I choose my prerogative There's so much love in me I got to give

        Oh how I could write a book on how you make me feel But how about this
        song that I wrote for you? What I feel like, I wanna put my trusts in
        these simple words For you to feel what I'm saying, what you feel like?
        Reminisce about the little episodes that we shared together Remember the
        time that you told me In the cold night, to relax when all I knew was to
        hold tight Remember the time that I spoke to the crowd in a full house
        and Realizes that you was my ace? I was the joker on the stage singing
        the blues All eyes on me and had nothing to prove But yo, I thought I
        knew what a diamond shine like But I felt a sharper love in the
        limelight From the queen of hearts watching me quietly from the upper
        deck balcony Sometimes I do suspect, I'm an actor in a well-scripted
        live divine comedy When I look back, that frozen slice of time and try
        to defrost the senses lost Now enough with the metaphors, the motivation
        that I wrote this letter for For you to know that the music helps carry
        on Like you say a new day will bring us tomorrow...
